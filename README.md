## Introduction
Understanding how different types of spending affect company performance is crucial for optimizing budgets and maximizing returns. This project focuses on analyzing three major spending categories: R&D, administration, and marketing.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains financial data from multiple companies, including:
- R&D Spend
- Administration Cost
- Marketing Spend
- Company Performance Metrics (e.g., revenue, profit)

The data is preprocessed to handle missing values and normalize the financial figures.

## Installation
To run this project locally, please ensure you have the following software and libraries installed:

- Python 3.7+
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spending-analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd spending-analysis
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Run the notebook cells to preprocess the data, conduct the analysis, and visualize the results.

## Analysis
The analysis involves:
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Correlation Analysis
- Regression Modeling
- Model Evaluation and Interpretation

We employ regression models to quantify the impact of R&D, administration, and marketing spends on company performance.

## Results
The results of the analysis highlight key insights, such as:
- The relative importance of each spending category
- Significant correlations between spends and performance metrics
- Recommendations for optimizing budget allocations
